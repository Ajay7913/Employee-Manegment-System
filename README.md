Project: Employee Management System (Console-Based)

ðŸ”¹ Description

The Employee Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage employees in an organization. It allows users to add employees (Managers and Developers), list all employees, and find the employee with the highest salary.

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as class & object creation, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also makes use of loops, arrays/ArrayList, user input handling, and conditional logic for data management.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Add Employees â†’ Users can add Managers or Developers with details like ID, Name, and Salary.

List Employees â†’ Displays details of all employees with their role (Manager/Developer).

Highest Salary Finder â†’ Identifies and displays the employee with the highest salary.

Polymorphism â†’ The role of an employee is determined by overridden methods.

Encapsulation â†’ Employee details are secured using private fields with getters.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used

Language: Java

Concepts: OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)

Data Handling: ArrayList (or Arrays)

User Interaction: Scanner for console input

ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes

Understanding of object-oriented programming in real-life scenarios.

Application of inheritance and polymorphism to differentiate between employee types.

Implementation of loops, arrays, and conditional logic for data storage and processing.

Hands-on experience with console-based input/output in Java.

ðŸ”¹ Example Usage

Add a Manager with salary details.
